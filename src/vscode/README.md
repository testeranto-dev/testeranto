in the primary activity bar, there are four sections:
1. "Tests" 
  - shows tests organized first by runtime (Node, Web, Python, Golang, Ruby), then by file structure
2. "Files" 
  - shows tree of files used in all tests
3. "Processes" 
  - shows live Docker containers and their status
4. "Features" 
  - shows test results from testeranto/reports/allTests/example/
  - This section integrates testeranto/bundles/allTests/node/example/Calculator.test.mjs-inputFiles.json and testeranto/reports/allTests/example/node.Calculator.test.ts.json
  - Overall it is a tree structure, first breaking down the files matching the source  code structure. The test.json should then be further broken folling the given-when-then structure.
